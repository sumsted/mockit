# Mockit

Create mock services in sandbox. Use custom metada entries to identify matching uri and method, then return status code and response.

Deploy to a sandbox to serve mock responses. Configure user to the connected app. 

Using OAuth2, password grant with credentials in body. 

Note client id and secret from connected app and username and password+security token.

If accessing from another sandbox use OAuth2 Salesforce connection for Auth Provider and login into mock sandbox during authorizations.
